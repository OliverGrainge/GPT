# GPT Model Training Repository

## Overview

This repository contains code for training a GPT-based model. The project is structured to handle the configuration, data preparation, model definition, and training processes for a GPT model.

## File Structure

- **`config.py`**: Contains configuration details for the model and training process, such as hyperparameters, file paths, and other settings.
- **`dataset.py`**: Manages dataset loading and preprocessing. This script is responsible for preparing the data pipeline required for model training.
- **`distributed.py`**: Provides functionalities for distributed training, allowing the model to be trained across multiple GPUs or machines.
- **`download_data.py`**: A utility script for downloading the necessary datasets or external files for training.
- **`model.py`**: Defines the architecture of the GPT model, including layers, forward passes, and other components.
- **`train.py`**: The main script for training the model. It includes code to initialize the model, load data, and handle training loops.
- **`utils.py`**: Contains various utility functions that are used throughout the project, such as logging, checkpoint saving, or performance metrics.

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies**: Ensure you have the required libraries installed by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Download data**: Use the `download_data.py` script to download the necessary datasets:
   ```bash
   python download_data.py
   ```

3. **Configure settings**: Adjust settings in `config.py` to suit your specific training environment, such as modifying hyperparameters, data paths, or training options.

4. **Train the model**: Run the `train.py` script to begin training:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

5. **Distributed training**: If you are training the model across multiple GPUs or machines, ensure that `distributed.py` is properly configured.
